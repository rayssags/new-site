I am a PhD student at the [Observatório do Valongo/UFRJ](https://ov.ufrj.br/pos-graduacao/), a member of the [Extragalactic Astronomy Laboratory](https://lasex-valongo.com/), and part of the [WALLABY](https://wallaby-survey.org/) collaboration. My current research focuses on dwarf galaxies in cosmic voids, studying their gas properties and chemical evolution. I have experience in mid-infrared spectroscopy and astrochemistry applied to the search for evidence of black holes in nearby and distant galaxies.
